Welcome to the TaskRabbit data science exercise.  We appreciate your
time and effort in completing this exercise.  It helps TaskRabbit
focus on candidates who are the best fit for the Data Scientist role,
and also helps the candidate get an idea of the type of data we work
with and the technical skills required to be successful in the role.

For this exercise, a sample data file is provided which contains
information about "recommendations".  A "recommendation" is the group
of Taskers from which the Client can choose one to book. In this
sample data, each recommendation can have up to 15 Taskers shown.

With this exercise, we want to understand what makes a Client choose a
Tasker. In particular, we want to use market data to build a model
that suggests hourly rates to Taskers that would maximize their
opportunity to be hired.

The sample data file is a CSV file of the form:

recommendation_id                          timestamp            tasker_id   position  hourly_rate  num_completed_tasks   hired   category

The columns are as follows:

 recommendation_id    unique identifier for this recommendation, or set of taskers shown
 timestamp            when this recommendation was shown to the client
 tasker_id            unique identifier for the Tasker
 position             the position of the Tasker in the recommendation set, 1 - first, 2 - second, etc.
 hourly_rate          the hourly rate for the Tasker when they were shown
 num_completed_tasks  the number of Tasks the Tasker had completed in that category, when they were shown
 hired                was the Tasker hired or not?  Only 1 tasker out of a set of recommendations can be hired
 category             the category of work the Client needs help with

Please describe in detail your approach, with code and visualization
that support your model. What are your dependent and independent
variables? Note that the ranking position is out of the Taskerâ€™s
control, and so also make an argument as to whether you decided to use
this information in your model.
